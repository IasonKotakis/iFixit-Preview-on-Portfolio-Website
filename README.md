# iFixit Guide - Apple Cinema Display

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this project, I am demonstrating on how I made my technical guide for disassembling and reassembling an Apple ThunderBolt Display with all the necessary safety equipment. My guide has managed to accumulate more than 1000 views and at the moment of writing this Github page, with more than 5 people have successfully to fix their issues with their LED Display panel on their Apple Thunderbolt Display.</p>
<br>
<p>You can find the published form of my technical guide on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Apple+LED+Cinema+Display+27-Inch+LED+Panel+Replacement/140309#s279703">iFixit's original website</a>.</p>

<h2>What is iFixit, you might ask </h2>
<p>The American how-to and e-commerce website iFixit offers free online repair manuals that resemble wikis and sells replacement parts for consumer electronics and gadgets. The business also disassembles consumer electronics products. The San Luis Obispo, California-based private company was established in 2003 as a result of Kyle Wiens's inability to find an Apple iBook G3 repair manual while the founders were students at Cal Poly.</p>
<p>iFixit currently has more than 1.5 million active users that help contribute in an open source community to help maintain our electronic products instead of disposing them thus polluting the environment even further.</p>

<h2>A summary of my work and its requirements</h2>
<p>iFixit provided me with specific guidelines on how the guidelines needs to look as well as on how we had to submit a proposal so we can check if it gets approved.</p>
<p>The proposal guidelines looked something like this:
    <ul>
        <li>The proposed title of your guide</li>
        <li>Your repair method</li>
        <li>Specific tools you will use for your repair</li>
        <li>Why this guide is necessary</li>
        <li>Repair information already on </li>
        <li>The Camera you will be using to document each step of the fix</li>
        <li>Does the repair already exist on the internet?</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2>The proposal</h2> 
<p>Initially the original idea was to fix an iPhone 12 Pro Max but due to the technical difficulties and specifications set by modern systems, has made it extremely difficult to fix them alone, as the diagnostics and configuration tools are closed-sourced by Apple, since it is an intellectual property.</p> 
<p>After a second thought I came with the solution of performing a repair on this Apple Thunderbolt Display for a few reasons: <ul>
    <li>The guide wasn't originally published on the iFixit website</li>
    <li>The system was more than 5 years old which means that I could have more research material to work with, considering the age of the system</li>
    <li>The guide could be formed with Q&A factors from different public forums</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Therefore, that is how I decided to focus on this model by Apple, and submitted my proposal to iFixit for review. Thankfully it was approved.</p>

<h2>Checkpoint 1</h2>
<p>The first requirement by iFixit was to create a rough layout of the guideline without including any sort of documentation therefore the first checkpoint only includes pictures with generated text so it could be assessed by an iFixit representative</p>

<h2>Checkpoint 2</h2>
<p>The second requirements by iFixit was to create the entire layout of the guideline that will be hosted on their website. After careful markup and scheduling, I managed to set up an adequate guide that explains on how to perform this repair as well as the duration and equipment needed to do so safely.
